                            <p>
                                The Shwedagon or Greater Dragon Pagoda is considered the most 
    sacred site in Buddhism in Myanmar because it contains a strand of 
    Buddha’s hair and other religious relics. The 2,500-year-old pagoda is 
    located on Singuttara Hill in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar. Over 
    the centuries, the pagoda has grown from 8 meters to 99 meters (26 feet 
    to 366 feet). The origins of Shwedagon are lost in antiquity but it is 
    estimated that the Pagoda was first built by the Mon during the Bagan 
    period, sometime between the 6th and 10th century AD. It is covered in 
    gold leaf; the stupa is covered in 4,531 diamonds. Numerous temples, 
    statues and stupas can be found at this unforgettable site. Pagoda 
    visitors are expected to follow a dress code (trousers preferred, 
    T-shirts with elbow-length sleeves) and enter the temple barefooted.

                            <p>
                                Travelers with a passion for Buddhist temples, pagodas and stupas
    should have a field day in Bagan, since it contains more of these than 
    any other place in the world. The most popular destination in Myanmar, 
    Bagan was the capital of the First Burmese Empire from the 9th to the 
    13th centuries. The site that Marco Polo once described as the “gilded 
    city” was home to around Buddhist 13,000 temples in its 11th-century 
    heyday. Thousands of temples, stupas and pagodas remain, including the 
    famous Ananda temple with its sparkling gold spires.

                        <p>
                            Ngapali combines two worlds in this Southeast Asian country. It 
        is Myanmar’s premier resort town, with white sand beaches lining the 
        blue waters of the Bay of Bengal and luxury hotels. It is a great spot 
        to chill out and just relax. Contrast this with its fishing village 
        atmosphere with local restaurants serving the day’s catch and ox-carts 
        doubling as taxis. Locals believe the town is named after Napoli 
        (Naples) in Italy. Most people visit Ngapali November to March; the rest
        of the year it is a sleepy little beach town.

						<h1>Inle Lake</h1>
						<br>
						<p>
							Vast and serene Inle Lake is one of the top tourist attractions 
in Myanmar. Besides its considerable natural beauty the lake also 
attracts tourists for the stilt houses of the Intha, the descendants of 
Mon people from the far southeast. A typical day-trip on the lake, taken
 in a long, narrow boat with a noisy outboard motor, will stick to the 
northern reaches of Inle Lake. These trips also include visits to small 
workshops in stilt villages, several pagodas and probably a market. 
Travelers are also likely to see fishermen propelling their boats using a
 distinctive leg-rowing technique, and other Intha residents of the lake
 tending to fruit and vegetables on floating gardens.

                        Inappropriate behavior is often laughed off as “boys will be 
boys,” women face higher conduct standards especially in the workplace. 
That’s why it’s crucial that, as women, our behavior on the job is 
beyond reproach. inappropriate behavior is often laughed.
